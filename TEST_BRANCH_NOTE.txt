⚠️ TESTING BRANCH - NOT A FINAL FIX ⚠️

This branch (test-validation-fix) is for TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.

Purpose:
--------
To identify the actual OCL mapping import errors and address configuration 
failures that caused backend configurations validation to be disabled.

What was changed:
-----------------
1. Uncommented the validate-configurations execution in pom.xml
2. Modified CI workflow to run on this test branch

This is NOT the final fix!
--------------------------
We are running the validation to see what errors occur in the CI environment
(ubuntu-latest with Docker), since local testing failed due to Docker Desktop
29.x compatibility issues with the Testcontainers library.

Once the CI runs and shows us the actual validation errors (expected OCL 
mapping failures and address configuration issues), we will:
1. Analyze the specific errors
2. Fix the OCL concept dependency issues
3. Fix any address hierarchy configuration problems
4. Create a proper fix with all issues resolved
5. Submit a real PR with the complete solution

This branch helps us diagnose the problem - it's not the solution itself.
