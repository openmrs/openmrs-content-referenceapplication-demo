# <u>Content Package of the demo data in the Reference Application</u>

This content package contains all the demo metadata for the reference application. 
🎁 Think of this like a **“starter kit”**, as it contains the metadata set-up that most teams would need (e.g. common Labs, Diagnoses, Drugs, etc). 

We still recommend that teams review configuration for accuracy and appropriateness before launching an EMR in production. 

⚠️ NOTE: The baseline metadata _required_ to run a version of O3 is found in the [Reference Application Content Package](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-content-referenceapplication).
